# Extension annotations

A few vital annotations help you correctly define, create and tweak the properties of the extension.
They all must be added before the class declaration.

## DesignerComponent

```java
@DesignerComponent(
        version = 1,
        description = "A simple addition extension",
        category = ComponentCategory.EXTENSION,
        nonVisible = true,
        iconName = "images/extension.png"
)
```

`@DesignerComponent` annotation serves as a declaration, enabling the identification of your extension with properties such as versioning, description etc.

| Properties                  | Values                                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| version: Integer            | version number                                |
| description: String         | additional details about your extension       |
| category: ComponentCategory | always set to \`ComponentCategory.EXTENSION\` |
| inonVisible: Boolean        | always set to \`true\`                        |
| iconName: String            | Http link to your image or local asset path   |

## SimpleObject

Since extensions are external components, it's vital to add the annotation to let the system know.

```java
@SimpleObject(external = true)
```
