# Introduction

Extensions are Add-Ins (first introduced in 2015) that extend the capabilities of App Inventor by providing access to new APIs or things which generally can't be done with in-built blocks.

# Requirements

Before you begin creating extensions, here are some things you'll need

- Git
- App Inventor Sources
- Java JDK 8
- Apache Ant
- Preferably, an IDE to work with (IntelliJ Idea, VS Code)
