# Getting Started

You'll be writing your first simple extension using App Inventor sources!

## Introduction

Extensions are Add-Ins (first introduced in 2015) that extend the capabilities of App Inventor by providing access to new APIs or things which generally can't be done with in-built blocks.

## Requirements

Before you begin creating extensions, here are some things you'll need

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [App Inventor Sources](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources)
- [Java JDK 8](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads)
- [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/)
- Preferably, an IDE to work with ([IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Verification

After installing all the requirements, it's vital to check if they are all installed properly.

Try running the commands below, they should produce similar output

```bash
$ git -v

git version 2.39.2
```

```bash
$ java -version && javac -version

openjdk version "1.8.0_352"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-8.352.08.1 (build 1.8.0_352-b08)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-8.352.08.1 (build 25.352-b08, mixed mode)
javac 1.8.0_352
```

```bash
$ ant -version

Apache Ant(TM) version 1.10.13 compiled on February 6 2023
```

## Cloning

Now, you'll need to clone the [mit-cml/appinventor-sources sources](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources),
it's around ~1.5 GB.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources
cd appinventor-sources
```
