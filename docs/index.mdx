# Getting Started

You'll be writing your first simple extension using App Inventor sources!

## Introduction

Extensions are Add-Ins (first introduced in 2015) that extend the capabilities of App Inventor by providing access to new APIs or things which generally can't be done with in-built blocks.

## Requirements

Before you begin creating extensions, here are some things you'll need

- Git
- App Inventor Sources
- Java JDK 8
- Apache Ant
- Preferably, an IDE to work with (IntelliJ Idea, VS Code)

## Cloning

You'll need to clone the mit-cml/appinventor-sources sources, it's around ~1.5 GB.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources
cd appinventor-sources
```
