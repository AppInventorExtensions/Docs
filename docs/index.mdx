# Getting Started

You'll be writing your first simple extension using App Inventor sources!

## Introduction

Extensions are Add-Ins (first introduced in 2015) that extend the capabilities of App Inventor by providing access to new APIs or things which generally can't be done with in-built blocks.

## Requirements

Before you begin creating extensions, here are some things you'll need

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [App Inventor Sources](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources)
- [Java JDK 8](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads)
- [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/)
- Preferably, an IDE to work with ([IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Cloning

You'll need to clone the [mit-cml/appinventor-sources sources](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources),
it's around ~1.5 GB.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources
cd appinventor-sources
```
