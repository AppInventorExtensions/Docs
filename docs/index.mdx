# Writing Extensions

You'll be writing your first simple extension using App Inventor sources!

## Introduction

Extensions are Add-Ins (first introduced in 2015) that extend the capabilities of App Inventor by providing access to new APIs or things which generally can't be done with in-built oblocks.

## Getting Started

You'll need to clone the [mit-cml/appinventor-sources](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources) sources, it's around ~1.5 GB.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources
cd appinventor-sources
```
