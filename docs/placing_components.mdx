# Placing Components

After you've cloned the App Inventor Sources and have the requirements ready, you can start writing your first extension.

## Directory structure

You can now open the directory `/appinventor/components/` with your desired IDE. Under the `/src` directory, you'll place your packages and extension sources.

```bash
appinventor-sources/
  └── appinventor/
       └── components/
            └── src/         <- This is where you'll place your components
```

## Creating Extension file

- Create a package directory under `/src`, i.e. `io/addition/test/` or use your package name.
- Now make a file "Addition.java"

```bash
appinventor-sources/
  └── appinventor/
       └── components/
            └── src/
                 └── io/
                      └── addition/
                           └── test/
                                └── Addition.java           <- Your extension source file
```
