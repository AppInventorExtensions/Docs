# Placing Components

After you've cloned the App Inventor Sources and have the requirements ready, you can start writing your first extension.

## Directory structure

You can now open the directory "/appinventor/components/" with your desired IDE. Under the `/src` directory, you'll place your packages and extension sources.

```bash
appinventor-sources/
  └── appinventor/
       └── components/
            └── src/         <- This is where you'll place your components
```
